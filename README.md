Formative Assessment : Supervised Learning



# Dataset:
* Use the breast cancer dataset available in the sklearn library.






## Explanation : ......

# Preprocessing steps explanation:
* StandardScaler is used to scale the features to have zero mean and unit variance.
* This is necessary to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.

# Algorithm descriptions:
* 1. Logistic Regression: A linear model that predicts probabilities.
* 2. Decision Tree: A tree-based model that splits data into regions.
* 3. Random Forest: An ensemble of decision trees that reduces overfitting.
* 4. SVM: A linear or nonlinear model that finds the best hyperplane.
* 5. k-NN: A model that predicts based on nearest neighbors.

# Best and worst performing algorithms:
* Best: Random Forest (accuracy: 0.97)
* Worst: Decision Tree (accuracy: 0.91)
